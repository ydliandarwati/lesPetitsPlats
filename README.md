Les petits plats is a website where user can find a recipe by searching among a large database in a very quick and a simple way. The users can use keyword and tags to find the desired recipe.
In this project, I use two types of search methode. The main branch uses the native loops and the advanced branch uses some array metodhes (Filter, map, every, include)
